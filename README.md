# React Demo App #

We're going to use React to build a simple one-page web application to display users from an API. We'll use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), an awesome tool for spinning up React applications quickly without fiddling with configuration.

This is the starting point for the application. All we did was pull a 

```
git clone https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app.git react-meetup
```

To clone the create-react-app repository into a new directory. Then we entered that directory and installed our dependencies using npm.

```
cd react-meetup
npm install
```

If you run an ```npm start``` from the new directory, your computer will open a blank React app with a logo and some text in your browser. That's great - everything's working. Now let's build our first react component!

This repository splits each development stage into branches. Head back to the react-meetup directory on the command line and run ```git checkout stage-1``` to move to [stage 1 of the app-building process](https://github.com/KiaFarhang/react-meetup/tree/stage-1).
